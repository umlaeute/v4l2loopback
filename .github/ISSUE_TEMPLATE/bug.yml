        Thanks for your feedback. It is invaluable for making `v4l2loopback` a better software.

        To help us making the most of your feedback (so we can e.g. fix bugs more quickly), please make sure to provide the information requested in this template.

        Please keep in mind that the development of `v4l2loopback` is done by volunteers.
        They are spending their spare time to give you a hopefully nice product and to help you if you have troubles - for free.

        If you are experiencing interoperability problems with a commercial product, contact *their* support first.

        Please search to see if an (open or closed) issue already exists for the bug you encountered.
        If so, consider adding more information to the existing issue, rather than creating a new one.

        If you are using additional software (e.g. `obs-studio`, `ffmpeg`, ...) please make sure to include full version information (and - if it is not a very common product - a link to their webpage).
        Please do not post screenshots of terminal output (e.g. when running `make`). Instead copy the the actual text.
        Use [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for formatting.
