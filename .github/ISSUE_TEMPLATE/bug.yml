        Thanks for your feedback. It is invaluable for making `v4l2loopback` a better software.

        To help us making the most of your feedback (so we can e.g. fix bugs more quickly), please make sure to provide the information requested in this template.

        Please keep in mind that the development of `v4l2loopback` is done by volunteers.
        They are spending their spare time to give you a hopefully nice product and to help you if you have troubles - for free.

        If you are experiencing interoperability problems with a commercial product, contact *their* support first.
